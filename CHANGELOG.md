# Changelog

All notable changes to Pasta Lite are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). While the version is 0.x,
minor versions may contain breaking changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Linux builds (alpha):** an x64 AppImage and Debian/Ubuntu `.deb`, built in CI and attached
  to draft releases with SHA256 checksums and signed build provenance (`gh attestation verify`).
  Both use the system git (2.51 or newer); the `.deb` declares that dependency. Linux still needs
  more hands-on testing across desktop environments.
- The branch switcher searches remote branches too: typing lists the matching remote branches no
  local branch tracks (picking one checks out a local tracking branch). The first query also
  fetches every remote in the background (skipped within a minute of the last successful fetch or
  pull), so the list includes branches pushed since then; the switcher notes the fetch while it
  runs and when it fails, and picking a branch meanwhile cancels it.

### Security

- Electron 44.9.3 (from 44.4.5): fixes pointer lock permission requests being attributed to the
  wrong frame (GHSA-x562-297c-g43g) and stops trusting the compromised eMudhra intermediate
  certificates (GHSA-jr5w-w6x2-84p9).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-13

### Added

- **Clone Repository…** (File menu, ⇧⌘N / Ctrl+Shift+N, or Clone… on the start screen and in the
  repository picker): clone from an `https://`, `http://`, `ssh://`, scp-like (`git@host:path`)
  or `git://` URL (remotes only: a local path or `file://` URL isn't cloned), into a folder you
  pick (remembered for next time; there is no default) under a name derived from the URL (never a
  hidden dot-folder, and no ':'). The dialog shows git's
  progress by phase with Cancel, and explains a failure by its cause (authentication, an unknown
  ssh host key, a repository that isn't there, a server that can't be reached, a folder that
  exists, no access, a full disk), with Back to fix it. The clone opens in the tab, or in a new tab
  next to a tab that has a repository open. A cancelled or failed clone leaves no folder behind: the
  folder is recorded as soon as it is created, so a removal that quitting (or a crash) cuts short
  finishes at the next start, only for that folder, and only with evidence that its clone failed;
  a clone that succeeded, or a folder in the recent list or a tab, is never removed. A clone whose files couldn't all be checked
  out (a path too long for Windows, say) can still be opened. Quitting or closing the tab
  during a clone asks first. URLs with a password, an access token as the user name, or a query
  string are refused before git runs, so no secret is saved in the repository's settings.
- Image preview in the diff view: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, AVIF, BMP, ICO and SVG files show before and
  after side by side, with dimensions, file size and the size change, on a checkerboard for
  transparency. Large images load on request; formats that can't be shown say so.
- Image comparison: besides side by side, **Swipe** (drag the divider between before and after),
  **Onion skin** (fade after over before) and **Difference** (unchanged pixels turn black). Zoom
  from 12.5% to 3200%, with Fit and 100%; pixels show as squares above 100%. Keys while an image
  shows: + and - zoom, 0 fits, 1 is 100%, M switches the comparison mode.
- An SVG's change opens as the rendered image, with a **Preview | Text** switch for its text diff.
  The choice is remembered.
- Images stored in Git LFS preview when their object is already downloaded (in `.git/lfs`); nothing
  is ever fetched, and an object that isn't there says "not available locally". In a partial clone
  (`--filter=blob:none`) a version the clone hasn't downloaded isn't fetched for the preview either:
  its pane says "Not downloaded in this partial clone", and shows it once it has been fetched.
- A conflicted image shows the base, ours and theirs versions side by side.
- HEIC, TIFF and PSD images preview on macOS through the system's thumbnailer (QuickLook). The pane
  says "Preview by macOS" and, for a large image, the size it was scaled to; dimensions and file size
  are the original's (turned, for a photo stored landscape and shown portrait). A multi-page TIFF
  shows its first page. On Windows and Linux, or when the system can't read the file, they still say
  "preview not supported".
- **Windows builds (alpha):** NSIS installers for x64 and arm64 and a portable x64 zip, with a
  `SHA256SUMS` file to check them against, since they aren't code-signed yet. A release workflow
  builds them from the tag and attaches them to a draft release. Alpha means the app works in
  testing on Windows 11 but has had little real use there: expect rough edges, and please report
  what you find. CI now runs the whole test suite on Windows too.

### Changed

- Fetch, Fetch All, Pull and Push explain a failed connection as Clone does: an unknown ssh host
  key, a host key that **changed** (with the fingerprint the server sent and the `ssh-keygen -R`
  command, never "accept"), a repository that isn't there, and a server that can't be reached (for
  Fetch and Pull a notice naming the remote and git's line). An ssh authentication failure names
  the user and host, the `ssh -T` command to check the key from a terminal, and how to add the key
  to ssh-agent on your platform; "Too many authentication failures" gets its own advice. The
  command uses the remote's host as configured (an alias stays an alias), and a host that isn't
  ASCII is shown in the form ssh saves. Clone's dialog uses the same texts.

### Fixed

- A cancelled fetch, pull, push or clone says what ssh had reported before the cancel (for example
  "Permission denied (publickey)"), instead of only "cancelled".

On Windows:

- Staging, unstaging and discarding hunks or lines, and discards that keep an undo backup, failed
  with `EINVAL`.
- Git's paths with forward slashes (`C:/...`) weren't matched to the folders the app opened, which
  broke worktree operations and caching of the repository root.
- Discarding many files at once could exceed Windows' command-line length limit.
- Cancelling an operation or quitting the app now stops git and every program it started, hook
  commands included, not just git itself. Cancelling a command that writes the index also removes
  the `index.lock` the stopped git left, which used to make the next command fail with
  "index.lock: File exists"; a lock another program's git holds is left alone. A git signing or
  connecting over ssh may have started a background agent (gpg-agent, an ssh connection master):
  it is stopped with the command and starts again when next needed.
- Git and its helpers no longer flash a console window.
- A safeguard for an ssh that prints its error and then never exits: when git's stderr ends with
  one of ssh's error lines (or the `@@@…` frame of its security warnings) and nothing follows for
  10 seconds, the fetch, pull, push or clone is ended and says what ssh reported, instead of
  waiting for the two-minute timeout (a clone, until cancelled). In testing, Windows' own OpenSSH
  behaved like that only when git ran inside an sshd session; on a desktop it exits after its
  error, and the safeguard has nothing to do. When it acts, the op ends about 10
  seconds after ssh's error, with its explanation.
- Windows' own OpenSSH no longer waits for a key passphrase or a host-key answer on a console
  nobody can see (an unknown host key left the app at "Working…" with no window to answer in):
  fetch, pull, push and clone give ssh Git for Windows' `false.exe` as its askpass, so ssh fails
  with its error and the op ends with the explanation: on a Windows desktop an unknown host key
  now fails in about 0.7 s and a passphrase-protected key in about 1.1 s, and no console window
  shows. An askpass you set yourself (`SSH_ASKPASS`, `SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE`) is left alone; MinGit
  has no `false.exe`.
- Git for Windows is found in its usual install folders (machine-wide or per user) when it isn't on
  the PATH.
- NTFS aliases of `.git` (its 8.3 short name, trailing dots or spaces, alternate data streams) are
  treated as the git folder, so a hunk or line action can't write into it.
- Paths are compared without regard to letter case and with either slash, as Windows does.
- Saving the app's settings and state retries when another program (an antivirus scan, the search
  indexer, a sync agent) briefly holds the file.
- Deleting or renaming an open repository is now noticed (it used to go unnoticed and could spin
  the CPU).
- Commits, stashes and ref changes made outside the app are no longer missed when Windows coalesces
  a burst of file changes.

### Security

Hardening against repositories from elsewhere (a downloaded or unzipped folder with its own `.git`).

- The **Trust and Open** prompt covers more of what can run a program. It now also lists, under
  their own heading, the risky settings and hooks of the repository's submodules (populated ones,
  nested ones, and submodule git folders that aren't checked out) and the risky settings git reads
  in the repository's other worktrees (their own `config.worktree`, or an `includeIf` that applies
  only there, which deleting a worktree reads). Any `include.path` or `includeIf` in the
  repository's own config is listed too, whatever it points at, since an include can bring in
  settings after a checkout. A repository trusted before asks again when one of these applies.
- Pasta Lite keeps git out of submodules wherever a flag can: status, working-tree diffs, checkout
  and branch switches, fetch and push no longer look inside or recurse into submodules, whatever
  the repository's config or `.gitmodules` says. A submodule now shows as changed only when its
  checked-out commit moved, not for changes inside it, and its diff is the one-line commit change.
- **Continue Rebase** and **Skip Commit** are refused for a rebase whose remaining steps run
  commands (`exec` lines), whoever started it; the banner says so and offers only **Abort Rebase**.
  Continue such a rebase in a terminal if you trust it.
- The macOS app has its Electron fuses set: it can't be run as plain Node, ignores `NODE_OPTIONS`
  and the `--inspect` flags, loads its code only from its `app.asar` and checks that archive
  against the hash embedded in the signed app. Interactive rebase no longer runs the app as its
  editor: git runs a fixed shell command instead.
- `npm run lint` runs ESLint from exact-pinned devDependencies locked in `package-lock.json`
  instead of fetching its dependencies with `npx`.

### Known issues

- On Windows, Git Credential Manager's sign-in window over HTTPS hasn't been checked by hand with
  the askpass change under Fixed; its automated checks pass (docs/plans/ssh-remote-errors.md §13,
  W12).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-04

### Added

- Delete several local branches at once. In the sidebar, ⌘-click (Ctrl-click on Windows and Linux)
  or ⌘/Ctrl+Space adds a branch to the selection and Shift-click or Shift+↑/↓ selects a range; Esc
  goes back to one. Right-click the selection for **Delete N branches**, or right-click a folder for
  **Delete all N branches in a folder** (subfolders included). One confirmation lists the branches;
  the checked-out branch and branches checked out in other worktrees are left out. Branches that
  aren't fully merged can be force-deleted together, and any that fail are listed without stopping
  the rest. Undo restores the deleted branches one at a time, newest first.
- Worktrees section in the sidebar. It lists the repository's worktrees, the main one included, with
  their branch or short SHA, marks the main and current worktrees, and shows locked (with the
  reason), missing and dirty states; dirty dots load while the section is open. Right-click a
  worktree to open it, reveal it in the file manager, copy its path, lock or unlock it (with an
  optional reason), or delete it; **Prune** previews what will be removed first. Deleting a worktree
  with changes asks for a force confirmation, and the main, current and locked worktrees are never
  deleted, nor one with a rebase or merge stopped in it, another worktree inside it or a git
  operation running there. Deleting a detached worktree warns how many of its commits no branch or
  tag keeps. The dirty check skips a worktree whose own config could run a command the repository
  wasn't trusted for. Changes made in a terminal show up automatically.
- A tab with a linked worktree open says so. Its tab shows a tree icon and reads `project · folder`
  (the window title too), and a **worktree** chip next to the repository name shows the worktree's
  folder and its main worktree; click it to jump to the worktree in the sidebar. Branches checked
  out in another worktree can't be checked out from the branch switcher, the sidebar or the graph;
  their Checkout is disabled with the worktree's path.

### Changed

- A repository trusted earlier under another spelling of its path (another letter case on a
  case-insensitive disk) is recognised, instead of asking again.

### Fixed

- Deleting a branch that is checked out in a linked worktree of a normal repository now says so up
  front instead of failing after the confirmation.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- The sidebar and the details panel can be resized: drag the handle on their inner edge (or focus
  it and use the arrow keys). Double-click the handle to reset a panel. Widths are kept across
  restarts.

### Changed

- The app is now called **Pasta Lite Git client** (in the Finder, the Dock, the window title and
  the app menu), so it is easier to find and clearly a git client. Your recent repositories, tabs,
  trusted repositories and logs are kept: they stay in the existing `Pasta Lite` folders. The DMG
  file names are unchanged (`Pasta-Lite-<version>-<arch>.dmg`). If you installed 0.1.0, delete
  the old `Pasta Lite` app from Applications after installing the new one, and quit the old app
  before opening the new one: only one copy runs at a time, so while 0.1.0 is open the new
  version brings its window forward instead of starting.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-27

The first public release, an **alpha**. Pasta Lite is a minimal, graph-first desktop git client
built on Electron that runs your system git. It covers the everyday workflow: staging, commits,
branches, fetch, pull and push, stash, merge, rebase (including interactive rebase), conflicts,
worktrees and undo. It needs git 2.51 or newer. macOS is the tested platform: download the DMG,
or run it from source with Node.js 22.12 or newer.

### Added

- **Commit graph**: a graph-first history of all branches, remotes, tags and stashes, with
  coloured lanes. More history loads as you scroll. The graph has resizable columns, a commit
  details panel, and a diff view for commits and for the working tree.
- **Staging**: stage and unstage by file, by hunk or by selected lines. Discard changes the same
  way, and a backup lets you undo a discard. Stage or unstage everything at once.
- **Commits**: commit and amend, with the last message offered when you amend, and a commit
  message draft that is kept per repository.
- **Remotes**: fetch, pull (merge or rebase, including fast-forward only) and push. A push that
  has to replace remote commits uses `--force-with-lease` against the remote-tracking ref you
  last saw. You can set an upstream, and cancel a running fetch, pull or push.
- **Branches**: check out, create and delete branches. Local changes that block a checkout are
  stashed and restored automatically. The sidebar lists local and remote branches, tags and
  stashes, with a filter.
- **Toolbar branch switcher** with a search field.
- **Stash**: stash, apply, pop and drop.
- **Undo and redo** driven by the HEAD reflog: commits, checkouts, discards and branch deletion.
- **Merge**: fast-forward, `--no-ff` or fast-forward only, with an automatic stash of local
  changes that comes back when the merge is done. Conclude or abort a merge that stopped.
- **Rebase**: rebase the current branch onto another. Interactive rebase has an editor to
  reorder, pick, reword, edit, squash, fixup and drop commits. Continue, skip or abort a rebase,
  and get a warning before rewriting commits that were already pushed.
- **Conflicts**: see conflicted files, resolve a file with ours or theirs, and mark everything
  resolved. A banner shows the merge or rebase in progress.
- **Worktrees**: linked worktrees open like any repository. A branch checked out in another
  worktree is reported clearly instead of failing with git's error.
- **Bare repositories**: open a bare repository and browse its history. The banner lists its
  worktrees and opens one in a tab. Operations that need a working tree are refused.
- **Tabs**: one repository per tab, restored at the next start.
- **Repository picker**: a start screen and toolbar picker with recent repositories, open tabs
  and Open Repository.
- **Trust prompt** before opening a repository whose own git config or hooks would run
  commands, bare or not. The `ext::` transport is always blocked.
- **Security**: sandboxed, context-isolated pages under a strict Content Security Policy, and an
  allowlisted IPC surface in which main supplies each tab's repository.
- **File watcher** that refreshes the view when the repository changes outside the app.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for the common actions, and Open in Terminal.
- **Diagnostics**: local JSON-lines logs with credentials redacted, local crash reports, and Help →
  Copy Diagnostics.
- Checks at startup for git 2.51 or newer, including when the app is launched from Finder.
- A dark theme, and the Pasta Lite logo and app icon.
- **macOS DMG builds** for Apple silicon (arm64) and Intel (x64), signed with a Developer ID and
  notarized by Apple. `npm run dist:mac:unsigned` builds unsigned DMGs locally
  (CONTRIBUTING.md, "Building the macOS app").

### Known limitations

- No clone or init: open an existing repository.
- No credential prompts: authentication has to work without one, through an SSH agent or a
  credential helper. The app never shows a terminal prompt.
- No cherry-pick, revert or reset.
- No tags UI: tags are shown in the graph and the sidebar, but you can't create, delete or push
  them.
- Dark theme only.
- Tested on macOS only. Windows and Linux are untested, and there are no builds for them.
- No automatic updates: download new versions from the Releases page.
- Authentication has only been tested against a local server. Real HTTPS and SSH remotes and
  credential helpers have not been checked end to end yet.
