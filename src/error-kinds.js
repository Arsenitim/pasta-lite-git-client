/*
 * Pasta Lite - the catalogue of error kinds (`err.kind`) the git layer and main set.
 *
 * Pure, dependency-free. Works in Node (`require('./src/error-kinds.js')`) and in the browser as
 * a plain <script> (exposes `window.PLErrorKinds`).
 *
 * KINDS: {NAME: 'kind-string'} (frozen); MEANING: {'kind-string': one line} (frozen);
 * isKind(s): true for a catalogued kind. The strings are the contract with the renderer
 * (Components.util.EXPECTED_KINDS) and the logs; test/error-kinds.test.js fails when a module
 * (src/, main/ or main.js) sets a kind that isn't listed here, or when an entry is no longer set anywhere.
